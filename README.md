# muskit's CPSC 240 code
Files `code.asm`, `driver.cpp`, and `r.sh` are boilerplate files. Each folder (except for 0.x) is an assignment I've done for class.

Code created on an Arch Linux install in *UTM*, a virtual machine application running on Apple M1 (ARM) emulating an x86_64 system.

***WARNING: MOST CODE WILL NOT WORK, AS THERE IS AN INACCURACY OF UTM THAT HAS AFFECTED CREATION OF THESE PROGRAMS (STACK BOUNDARY LINE-UP).***
